/* The DCC interface daemon is intended for use with programs that
 * need a more efficient DCC client than dccproc.  The dccif daemon
 * receives messages containing SMTP messages including their envelopes,
 * checks the messages' checksums with a DCC server, and answers
 * with indications of what to do with the mail messages.
 *
 * The protocol used by dccif is simple and easily implemented even
 * in shell scripts.  The protocol uses ASCII strings delimited by '\n'
 * despite their reduced efficiency, because strings are quicker and
 * easier to handle in scripts.  There are Perl and C implementations of the
 * interface that are useful in common situations.
 *
 * The interface daemon is given
 *	optional information including whether the message is spam: */
#define DCCIF_OPT_LOG	    "log"	/* log the transaction */
#define DCCIF_OPT_SPAM	    "spam"	/* message is known to be spam */
#define DCCIF_OPT_BODY	    "body"	/* daemon should return the body */
#define DCCIF_OPT_HEADER    "header"    /* return only the header */
#define DCCIF_OPT_CKSUMS    "cksums"    /* return only the header & checksums */

 *	    Only something like an MTA can decide whether user@domain
 *	    example.com, user@example.com, and user@domain.com are the same
 *	    or different mailboxes and so should have one, two, or three
 *	    per-user logs.  Without a local user name, dccifd can do no per-user
 *	    logging or whitelisting.
 *	    With no recipients, dccifd will assume a query is intended.
