DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     DDccccpprroocc is a low performance DCC client for checking single mail messages
     for mail filters such as procmail(1)

     DDccccpprroocc copies a complete SMTP message from standard input or a file to
     standard output or another file.  As it copies the message, it computes
     the DCC checksums for the message, reports them to a DCC server, and adds
     a header line to the message.  Another program such as procmail(1) can
     use the added header line to filter mail or the exit ddccccpprroocc exit status.

     Error messages are sent to stderr as well as the system log.  Connect
     stderr and stdout to the same file to see errors in context, but direct
     stderr to /dev/null to keep DCC error messages out of the mail.  The --oo
     option can also be used to separate the error messages.

     DDccccpprroocc sends reports of checksums related to mail received by DCC
     clients and queries about the total number of reports of particular
     checksums.  A DCC server receives no mail, address, headers, or other
     information, but only cryptographically secure checksums of such informa-
     tion.  A DCC server cannot determine the text or other information that
     corresponds to the checksums it receives.  It only acts as a clearing-
     house of counts of checksums computed by clients.

     The checksums of private mail, the internal mail,and other mail that is
     known to not be unsolicited bulk can be listed in a whitelist specified
     with

     When sendmail(8) is used, dccm(8) is a better DCC interface.  Dccifd(8)
     is more efficient than ddccccpprroocc because it is a daemon, but that has costs
     in complexity.  See dccsight(8) for a way to use previously computed
     checksums.

   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     The following options are available:

     --VV   displays the program's version.  Two or more --VV options show the
          options with which it was built.

     --dd   enables debugging output from the DCC client software.  Additional
          --dd options increase the number of messages.  One causes error mes-
          sages to be sent to STDERR as well as the system log.

     --AA   adds to existing X-DCC headers in the message instead of replacing
          existing headers of the brand of the current server.

     --PP   The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP
          header fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
          However, there are situations when ddccccpprroocc knows that a mail message
          is extremely bulky and probably spam.  For example, mail from a
          sender that is blacklisted in _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t gets an X-DCC header that
          includes _b_u_l_k.  To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default
          whenever ddccccpprroocc generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk", it
          also forces the _B_o_d_y count to "many".  --PP turns off that kludge and
          the _B_o_d_y contains the count from the DCC server.

     --QQ   only queries the DCC server about the checksums of messages instead
          of reporting.  This is useful when ddccccpprroocc is used to filter mail
          that has already been reported to a DCC server by another DCC
          client.  No single mail message should be reported to a DCC server
          more than once per recipient, because each report will increase the
          apparent "bulkness" of the message.

          It is better to use _M_X_D_C_C lines in the global _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t
          file for your MX mail servers that use DCC than to use --QQ with
          ddccccpprroocc.

          Do not use --QQ except on mail that you know has been reported to a
          DCC server.  DCC depends on reports of all except known private mail
          and works only because almost no DCC installations use --QQ.

     --CC   outputs only the X-DCC header and the checksums for the message.

     --HH   outputs only the X-DCC header.

     --EE   adds lines to the start of the log file turned on with --ll and --cc
          describing what might have been the envelope of the message.  The
          information for the inferred envelope comes from arguments including
          --aa and headers in the message when --RR is used.  No lines are gener-
          ated for which no information is available, such as the envelope
          recipient.

     --PP   The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP
          header fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
          However, there are situations when ddccccpprroocc knows that a mail message
          is extremely bulky and probably spam.  For example, mail from a
          sender that is blacklisted in _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t gets an X-DCC header that
          includes _b_u_l_k.  To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default
          whenever ddccccpprroocc generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk", it
          also forces the _B_o_d_y count to "many".  --PP turns off that kludge and
          the _B_o_d_y contains the count from the DCC server.

     --RR   says the first Received lines have the standard
          "helo (name [address])..."  format and the address is that of the
          SMTP client that would otherwise be provided with --aa.  The --aa option
          should be used if the local SMTP server adds a Received line with
          some other format or does not add a Received line.  Received headers
          specifying IP addresses marked _M_X or _M_X_D_C_C in the --ww _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file
          are skipped.

     --hh _h_o_m_e_d_i_r
          overrides the default DCC home directory, _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c.

     --mm _m_a_p
          specifies a name or path of the memory mapped parameter file instead
          of the default _/_v_a_r_/_d_c_c_/_m_a_p.  It should be created with the nneeww mmaapp
          operation of the cdcc(8) command.

     --ww _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t
          specifies an optional file containing SMTP client IP addresses and
          SMTP headers of mail that do not need X-DCC headers and whose check-
          sums should not be reported to the DCC server.  It can also contain
          checksums of spam.  If the pathname is not absolute, it is relative
          to the DCC home directory.  Thus, individual users with private
          whitelists usually specify them with absolute paths.  Common
          whitelists shared by users must be in the DCC home directory or one
          of its subdirectories and owned by the set-UID user of ddccccpprroocc.  It
          is useful to _i_n_c_l_u_d_e a common or system-wide whitelist in private
          lists.

          Because the contents of the _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file are used frequently, a
          companion file is automatically created and maintained.  It has the
          same pathname but with an added suffix of _._d_c_c_w.  It contains a mem-
          ory mapped hash table of the main file.

          _O_p_t_i_o_n lines can be used to modify many aspects of ddccccpprroocc filter-
          ing, as described in the main dcc(8) man page.  For example, an
          _o_p_t_i_o_n _s_p_a_m_-_t_r_a_p_-_d_i_s_c_a_r_d_s line turns off DCC filtering and reports
          the message as spam.

     --TT _t_m_p_d_i_r
          changes the default directory for temporary files from the system
          default.  The system default is often _/_t_m_p.

     --aa _I_P_-_a_d_d_r_e_s_s
          specifies the IP address (not the host name) of the immediately pre-
          vious SMTP client.  It is often not available.  --aa _0_._0_._0_._0 is
          ignored.  --aa.  The --aa option should be used instead of --RR if the
          local SMTP server adds a Received line with some other format or
          does not add a Received line.

     --ff _e_n_v___f_r_o_m
          specifies the RFC 821 envelope "Mail From" value with which the mes-
          sage arrived.  It is often not available.  If --ff is not present, the
          contents of the first Return-Path: or UNIX style From_ header is
          used.  The _e_n_v___f_r_o_m string is often but need not be bracketed with
          "<>".

     --tt _t_a_r_g_e_t_s
          specifies the number of addressees of the message if other than 1.
          The string _m_a_n_y instead of a number asserts that there were too many
          addressees and that the message is unsolicited bulk email.

     --xx _e_x_i_t_c_o_d_e
          specifies the code or status with which ddccccpprroocc exits if the --cc
          thresholds are reached or the --ww _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file blacklists the mes-
          sage.

          The default value is EX_NOUSER.  EX_NOUSER is 67 on many systems.
          Use 0 to always exit successfully.

     --cc _t_y_p_e_,[_l_o_g_-_t_h_o_l_d_,]_r_e_j_-_t_h_o_l_d
          sets logging and "spam" thresholds for checksum _t_y_p_e.  The checksum
          types are _I_P, _e_n_v___F_r_o_m, _F_r_o_m, _M_e_s_s_a_g_e_-_I_D, _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_e, _R_e_c_e_i_v_e_d,
          _B_o_d_y, _F_u_z_1, _F_u_z_2, _r_e_p_-_t_o_t_a_l, and _r_e_p.  The first six, _I_P through
          _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_e, have no effect except when a local DCC server configured
          with --KK is used.  The _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_e thresholds apply to the first sub-
          stitute heading encountered in the mail message.  The string _A_L_L
          sets thresholds for all types, but is unlikely to be useful except
          for setting logging thresholds.  The string _C_M_N specifies the com-
          monly used checksums _B_o_d_y, _F_u_z_1, and _F_u_z_2.  _R_e_j_-_t_h_o_l_d and _l_o_g_-_t_h_o_l_d
          must be numbers, the string _N_E_V_E_R, or the string _M_A_N_Y indicating
          millions of targets.  Counts from the DCC server as large as the
          threshold for any single type are taken as sufficient evidence that
          the message should be logged or rejected.

          _L_o_g_-_t_h_o_l_d is the threshold at which messages are logged.  It can be
          handy to log messages at a lower threshold to find solicited bulk
          mail sources such as mailing lists.  If no logging threshold is set,
          only rejected mail and messages with complicated combinations of
          white and blacklisting are logged.  Messages that reach at least one
          of their rejection thresholds are logged regardless of logging
          thresholds.

          _R_e_j_-_t_h_o_l_d is the threshold at which messages are considered "bulk,"
          and so should be rejected or discarded if not whitelisted.

          DCC Reputation thresholds in the commercial version of DCC are con-
          trolled by thresholds on checksum types _r_e_p and _r_e_p_-_t_o_t_a_l.  The DCC
          Reputations of IP addresses that the DCC database says have sent
          more than _r_e_p_-_t_o_t_a_l_,_l_o_g_-_t_h_o_l_d are computed and messages from those
          addresses are logged.  Messages from IP addresses with DCC Reputa-
          tions of at least the _r_e_p_,_r_e_j_-_t_h_o_l_d rejection threshold can be
          rejected.  The DCC Reputation of an IP address is the percentage of
          its messages known to have been sent to at least 10 recipients.  The
          defaults are equivalent to _r_e_p_,_n_e_v_e_r and _r_e_p_-_t_o_t_a_l_,_n_e_v_e_r_,_2_0.

          Bulk DCC Reputations do not reject mail unless enabled by an
          _o_p_t_i_o_n _D_C_C_-_r_e_p_-_o_n line a _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file.

          The checksums of locally whitelisted messages are not checked with
          the DCC server and so only the number of targets of the current copy
          of a whitelisted message are compared against the thresholds.

          The default is _A_L_L_,_N_E_V_E_R, so that nothing is discarded, rejected, or
          logged.  A common choice is _C_M_N_,_2_5_,_5_0 to reject or discard mail with
          common bodies except as overridden by the whitelist of the DCC
          server, the sendmail _$_{_d_c_c___i_s_s_p_a_m_} and _$_{_d_c_c___n_o_t_s_p_a_m_} macros, and
          --gg, and --ww.

     --gg [_n_o_t_-]_t_y_p_e
          indicates that whitelisted, _O_K or _O_K_2, counts from the DCC server
          for a type of checksum are to be believed.  They should be ignored
          if prefixed with _n_o_t_-.  _T_y_p_e is one of the same set of strings as
          for --cc.  Only _I_P, _e_n_v___F_r_o_m, and _F_r_o_m are likely choices.  By default
          all three are honored, and hence the need for _n_o_t_-.

     --SS _h_d_r
          adds to the list of substitute or locally chosen headers that are
          checked with the --ww _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file and sent to the DCC server.  The
          checksum of the last header of type _h_d_r found in the message is
          checked.  _H_d_r can be _H_E_L_O to specify the SMTP envelope HELO value.
          _H_d_r can also be _m_a_i_l___h_o_s_t to specify the host name from the
          Mail_from value in the SMTP envelope.  As many as 8 different sub-
          stitute headers can be specified, but only the checksum of the first
          will be sent to the DCC server.

     --ii _i_n_f_i_l_e
          specifies an input file for the entire message instead of standard
          input.  If not absolute, the pathname is interpreted relative to the
          directory in which ddccccpprroocc was started.

     --oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
          specifies an output file for the entire message including headers
          instead of standard output.  If not absolute, the pathname is inter-
          preted relative to the directory in which ddccccpprroocc was started.

     --ll _l_o_g_d_i_r
          specifies a directory for copies of messages whose checksum target
          counts exceed --cc thresholds.  The format of each file is affected by
          --EE.

          See the FILES section below concerning the contents of the files.
          See also the _o_p_t_i_o_n _l_o_g_-_s_u_b_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_{_d_a_y_,_h_o_u_r_,_m_i_n_u_t_e_} lines in
          _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t files described in dcc(8).

          The directory is relative to the DCC home directory if it is not
          absolute

     --BB _d_n_s_b_l_-_o_p_t_i_o_n
          enables DNS white- and blacklist checks of the SMTP client IP
          address, SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain name, and of host
          names in URLs in the message body.  Body URL blacklisting has too
          many false positives to use on abuse mailboxes.  It is less effec-
          tive than greylisting with dccm(8) or dccifd(8) but can be useful in
          situations where greylisting cannot be used.  It can be combined
          with greylisting.

          _D_o_m_a_i_n is a DNS blacklist domain such as _e_x_a_m_p_l_e_._c_o_m that will be
          searched.  The strings _a_n_y, _I_P_a_d_d_r, _I_P_a_d_d_r_/_x_x, or _I_P_a_d_d_r_L_O_-_I_P_a_d_d_r_H_I,
          specifies which IP addresses found in the DNS blacklist after apply-
          ing the optional IP address mask _I_P_m_a_s_k say that mail messages
          should be rejected or accepted with --BB _s_e_t_:_w_h_i_t_e.  "127.0.0.2" is
          assumed if no address(es) are specified.  IPv6 addresses can be
          specified with the usual colon (:) notation.  Host names can be used
          instead of numeric addresses.  The type of DNS blacklist is speci-
          fied by _b_l_t_y_p_e as _n_a_m_e, _a_l_l_-_n_a_m_e_s, _I_P_v_4, or _I_P_v_6.  Given an envelope
          sender domain name or a domain name in a URL of spam.domain.org and
          a blacklist of type _n_a_m_e, spam.domain.org.example.com will be looked
          up.  The names spam.domain.org.example.com, domain.org.example.com,
          and org.example.com will be looked up in blacklists of type
          _a_l_l_-_n_a_m_e_s.  Use _n_a_m_e with DNS blacklists that use wildcards for
          speed but _a_l_l_-_n_a_m_e_s for other DNS name blacklists.  Blacklist types
          of _I_P_v_4 and _I_P_v_6 require that the domain name in a URL sender
          address be resolved into an IPv4 or IPv6 address.  The resolved
          address from the mail message is then written as a reversed string
          of decimal octets to check the DNS blacklist, as in
          _2_._0_._0_._1_2_7_._e_x_a_m_p_l_e_._c_o_m.

          A _d_o_m_a_i_n of "."  and type of _n_a_m_e can be used to blacklist domain
          names with specified addresses.  This can be useful to detect URLs
          with domain names listed in a Response Policy Zone (RPZ).  For exam-
          ple, the following can be used to reject mail containing URLs listed
          by a response policy zone that maps evil domain names to 224.0.0.0
          with an informative status message:

            '-Bset:rej-msg=5.7.1 550 %ID %BTYPE \
                  https://example.com/query/dbl?domain=%BTGT'
            -B.,224.0.0.0,name

          More than one blacklist can be specified and blacklists can be
          grouped with --BB _s_e_t_:_g_r_o_u_p_=_X.  All searching within a group of black-
          lists is stopped at the first positive result.

          Unlike dccm(8) and dccifd(8), no _o_p_t_i_o_n _D_N_S_B_L_-_o_n line is required in
          the _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file.  A --BB argument is sufficient to show that DNSBL
          filtering is wanted by the ddccccpprroocc user.

               group 1, 2, 3, or 4.

          --BB _s_e_t_:_d_e_b_u_g_=_X

          --BB _s_e_t_:_m_s_g_-_s_e_c_s_=_S
               limits ddccccpprroocc to _S seconds total for checking all DNS black-
               lists.  The default is 25.

          --BB _s_e_t_:_U_R_L_-_s_e_c_s_=_S
               limits ddccccpprroocc to at most _S seconds resolving and checking any
               single URL or IP address.  The default is 11.  Some spam con-
               tains dozens of URLs and some "spamvertised" URLs contain host
               names that need minutes to resolve.  Busy mail systems cannot
               afford to spend minutes checking each incoming mail message.

          specifies how messages should be logged.  _L_t_y_p_e must be _e_r_r_o_r, _i_n_f_o,
          or _o_f_f to indicate which of the two types of messages are being con-
          trolled or to turn off all syslog(3) messages from ddccccpprroocc.  _L_e_v_e_l
          must be a syslog(3) level among _E_M_E_R_G, _A_L_E_R_T, _C_R_I_T, _E_R_R, _W_A_R_N_I_N_G,

     ddccccpprroocc exits with 0 on success and with the --xx value if the --cc thresh-
     olds are reached or the --ww _w_h_i_t_e_c_l_n_t file blacklists the message.  If at
     all possible, the input mail message is output to standard output or the
     --oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e despite errors.  If possible, error messages are put into the
     system log instead of being mixed with the output mail message.  The exit
     status is zero for errors so that the mail message will not be rejected.

     If ddccccpprroocc is run more than 500 times in fewer than 5000 seconds, ddccccpprroocc
     tries to start Dccifd(8).  The attempt is made at most once per hour.
     Dccifd is significantly more efficient than ddccccpprroocc.  With luck, mecha-
     nisms such as SpamAssassin will notice when dccifd is running and switch
     to dccifd.
