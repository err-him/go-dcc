.Op Fl C Ar 'type h1 h2 h3 h4'

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Dblist
lists the contents of a DCC database as it does some consistency
checking.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Fl v
lists more of the database.
Additional information is produced with additional
.Fl v
arguments.
.It Fl V
displays the version of the DCC database lister.
Two or more
.Fl V
options show the options with which it was built.
.It Fl H
turns off the listing of the hash table as well as the analysis
of the hash table.
Determining the worst case and average lengths of chains in the
hash table can take a long time for a large database on a small computer.
.It Fl D
turns off the listing of the data or checksum records.
.It Fl G Ar on
lists a greylist database.
.It Fl h Ar homedir
overrides the default DCC home directory,
.Pa @prefix@ .
.It Fl C Ar 'type h1 h2 h3 h4'
limits the listing to records containing that checksum or one of
the other checksums specified with
.Fl C .
If the four hexadecimal values
.Ar h1 h2 h3 h4
are absent,
records with the matching
.Ar type
will be listed.
If
.Ar type
is absent, any checksum with the four hexadecimal values will be listed.
If the hexadecimal values
.Ar h1 h2 h3 h4
are absent,
all checksums of the specified type will be listed.
.Pp
The alternate form
.Bk -words
.Ar 'server-ID {simple|commercial|ignore|rogue} at ID'
.Ek
can be used to select
.Ar server-ID
records of some types.
.Pp
As many as 16 checksums can be specified.
.It Fl I Ar server-ID
limits the listing to records with that server-ID or one of the other
server-IDs specified with
.Fl I .
As many as 16 server-IDs can be specified.
.It Fl A Ar dbaddr
excludes database records before
.Ar dbaddr .
.It Fl L Ar pathlen
excludes records with path lengths shorter than
.Ar pathlen .
.It Fl P Ar pages
ignores all but the last
.Ar pages
of the database.
.It Fl T Ar timetamp
excludes records with other timestamps.
A timestamp with a missing microsecond value matches
any record with that second.
As many as 16
timestamps can be specified.
.It Ar file1 file2 ...
are names of databases to be listed.
The default is
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_db
and its companion,
.Pa @prefix@/dcc_db.hash .
When
.Fl G Ar on
is used, the
default files are
.Pa @prefix@/grey_db
and
.Pa @prefix@/grey_db.hash .
.El
.Pp
By default, the sizes of the main file and the hash table as well
as how much they contain and values related to the performance of
the hash are displayed.
.Pp
With a single
.Fl v ,
most of the mail database file and the contents of memory
mapped server flooding positions in the
.Pa @prefix@/flod.map
file  are listed.
The listing starts with the serial number of the database file
which is when old entries were last removed from it by
.Xr dbclean 8
That is followed by similar lines showing the oldest timestamp
of checksums not expired by dbclean
and of mail that is not "spam."
.Pp
The flooding positions from the
.Pa @prefix@/flod.map
file are record offsets or addresses in the main database file.
.Pp
A typical record in the main database file looks like:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
02/07/02 20:25:12.497032    5	      1601		2fe5b94
     path: 103<-101<-1601
  Body	    6	    e2d3f96a c65aea01 3fece361 edff9ecf  2f21364 772d2
  Fuz1	    many    6ff56fe8 ffc312d7 a5fe8f13 12a537ae  2f21364 200a9
  Fuz2	    many    fac882b8 03eea34f bd792c40 2fe6fd54  2f21364 72816
.Ed
.Pp
That example
was received by a DCC server with server-ID
.Em 1601
at about 8:25 UTC on the evening of February 7, 2000.
The report was about a mail message set to
.Em 5
addressees.
The report was then sent or
.Sq flooded
to the server with server-ID
.Em 101
which in turn sent it to a server with server-ID
.Em 103 .
That server sent it to the local DCC server.
The record is at the address
.Em 0x2fe5b94
in the database.
The record contains 3 checksums.
The simple checksum of the body of the message was
.Em 0xe2d3f96a 0xc65aea01 0x3fece361 0xedff9ecf
The total number of recipients of messages with this body checksum
known in the database is
.Em 6 ,
which implies this checksum had been previously reported with a target
count of 1.
The previous report in the database of a message with this body checksum
is at
.Em 0x2f21364 .
The hash table chain for this body checksum is computed to start at
.Em 0x772d2 .
This report included two fuzzy checksums.
Both have been previously reported as having been sent to
.Em many
targets.
.Pp
An asterisk (*) before the type of the checksum
indicates that this checksum is redundant.
A report of
.Em many
addressees makes all preceding reports redundant.
.Pp
The flooding of some database records is delayed, as shown by the string
.Em delayed
after the server-ID.
.Pp
The string
.Em trimmed
after the server-ID
marks older reports that have had uninteresting checksums removed.
The string
.Em compressed
after the server-ID
would indicate that this older report has been trimmed and compressed with
older reports.
.Pp
With two
.Fl v
arguments,
records added to the database by
.Xr dbclean 8
from the server whitelist are also displayed.
.Pp
Three
.Fl v
arguments cause the hash table to be displayed.
Three typical hash table entries look like:
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
      19b8:   19ee   19b7
      19b9:   19c0      0    90120 Fuz1
      19ba:      0      0  1b72300 Fuz1
.Ed
.Pp
The entry in slot number
.Em 0x19b8
is unused or free.
Slot number
.Em 0x19b9
is the start of a chain of collisions or entries
with the same hash value of 0x19b9.
The next slot in this chain is at
.Em 0x19c0 .
The corresponding
.Em Fuz1
checksum is at
.Em 0x9012
in the database.
The third slot at
.Em 0x19ba
is also that of a
.Em Fuz1
checksum,
but it is not part of a hash chain and its database record
is at
.Em 0x1b72300 .
