<H2 ID="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     <B>dccm</B> is a daemon built with the sendmail milter interface intended to
     connect <B>sendmail(8)</B> to DCC servers.  When built with the milter filter
     machinery and configured to talk to <B>dccm</B> in the <I>sendmail.cf</I> file, send-
     mail passes all email to <B>dccm</B> which in turn reports related checksums to
     the nearest DCC server.  <B>dccm</B> then adds an <I>X-DCC</I> SMTP header line to the
     message.  Sendmail is told to reject the message if it is unsolicited
     bulk mail.

     <B>Dccm</B> sends reports of checksums related to mail received by DCC clients
     and queries about the total number of reports of particular checksums.  A
     DCC server receives <I>no</I> mail, address, headers, or other information, but
     only cryptographically secure checksums of such information.  A DCC
     server cannot determine the text or other information that corresponds to
     the checksums it receives.  Its only acts as a clearinghouse of counts
     for checksums computed by clients.  For complete privacy as far as the
     DCC is concerned, the checksums of purely internal mail or other mail
     that is known to not be unsolicited bulk can be listed in a whitelist to
     not be reported to the DCC server.

     Since the checksums of messages that are whitelisted locally by the
     <I>/var/dcc/whiteclnt</I> file are not reported to the DCC server, <B>dccm</B> knows
     nothing about the total recipient counts for their checksums and so can-
     not add <I>X-DCC</I> header lines to such messages.  Sendmail does not tell <B>dccm</B>
     about messages that are not received by sendmail via SMTP, including mes-
     sages submitted locally and received via UUCP, and so they also do not
     receive <I>X-DCC</I> header lines.

     Enable the daemon and put its parameters in the <I>/var/dcc/conf</I> file and
     start the daemon with the <I>/var/dcc/libexec/start-dccm</I> or
     <I>/var/dcc/libexec/rcDCC</I> scripts.

     The list of servers that <B>dccm</B> contacts is in the memory mapped file
     <I>/var/dcc/map</I> shared by local DCC clients.  The file is  maintained with
     <B><A HREF="cdcc.html">cdcc(8)</A></B>.

   <B ID="OPTIONS">OPTIONS</B>
     The following options are available:

     <B ID="OPTION-V">-V</B>   displays the version of <B>dccm</B>.  Two or more <B>-V</B> options show the
          options with which it was built.

     <B ID="OPTION-d">-d</B>   enables debugging output from the DCC client software.  Additional
          <B>-d</B> options increase the number of messages.  A single <B>-d</B> logs
          aborted SMTP transactions including those from some "dictionary
          attacks."

     <B ID="OPTION-b">-b</B>   causes the daemon to not detach itself from the controlling tty and
          put itself into the background.

     <B ID="OPTION-x">-x</B>   causes the daemon to try "extra hard" to contact a DCC server.
          Since it is usually more important to deliver mail than to report
          its checksums, <B>dccm</B> normally does not delay too long while trying to
          contact a DCC server.  It will not try again for several seconds
          after a failure.  With <B>-x</B>, it will always try to contact the DCC
          server and it will tell the MTA to answer the DATA command with a
          4yz temporary failure.

     <B ID="OPTION-A">-A</B>   adds to existing X-DCC headers in the message instead of replacing
          existing headers of the brand of the current server.

     <B ID="OPTION-N">-N</B>   neither adds, deletes, nor replaces existing X-DCC headers in the
          message.  Each mail message is logged, rejected, and otherwise han-
          dled the same.

     <B ID="OPTION-P">-P</B>   The SpamAsassin DCC.pm plugin should watch for "bulk" in X-DCC SMTP
          header fields, but historically has looked for counts of "many".
          However, there are situations when <B>dccm</B> knows that a mail message is
          extremely bulky and probably spam.  For example, mail from a sender
          that is blacklisted in <I>whiteclnt</I> gets an X-DCC header that includes
          <I>bulk</I>.  To acommodate that bug in SpamAssassin, by default whenever
          <B>dccm</B> generates an X-DCC header containing "bulk", it also forces the
          <I>Body</I> count to "many".  <B>-P</B> turns off that kludge and the <I>Body</I> con-
          tains the count from the DCC server.

     <B ID="OPTION-Q">-Q</B>   only queries the DCC server about the checksums of messages instead
          of reporting.  This is useful when <B>dccm</B> is used to filter mail that
          has already been reported to a DCC server by another DCC client.  No
          single mail message should be reported to a DCC server more than
          once per recipient, because each report will increase the apparent
          "bulkness" of the message.

          It is better to use <I>MXDCC</I> lines in the global <I>/var/dcc/whiteclnt</I>
          file for your MX mail servers that use DCC than to use <B>-Q</B> with <B>dccm</B>.

          Do not use <B>-Q</B> except on mail that you know has been reported to a
          DCC server.  DCC depends on reports of all except known private mail
          and works only because almost no DCC installations use <B>-Q</B>.

     <B ID="OPTION-G">-G</B> <I>on</I> | <I>off</I> | <I>noIP</I> | <I>IPmask/xx</I>
          controls <I>greylisting</I>.  At least one working greylist server must be
          listed in the <I>/var/dcc/map</I> file.  If more than one is named, they
          must "flood" or change checksums and they must use the same <B>-G</B>
          parameters.  See <B><A HREF="dccd.html">dccd(8)</A></B>.  Usually all dccm or dccifd DCC client
          processes use the same <B>-G</B> parameters.

          <I>IPmask/xx</I> and <I>noIP</I> remove part or all of the IP address from the
          greylist triple.

     <B ID="OPTION-h">-h</B> <I>homedir</I>
          overrides the default DCC home directory, <I>/var/dcc</I>.

     <B ID="OPTION-I">-I</B> <I>user</I>
          specifies the UID and GID of the process.

     <B ID="OPTION-p">-p</B> <I>protocol:filename</I> | <I>protocol:port@host</I>
          specifies the protocol and address by which sendmail will contact
          <B>dccm</B>.  The default is a UNIX domain socket in the "run" directory,
          <I>/var/run/dcc/dccm</I>.  (See also <B>-R)</B> This protocol and address must
          match the value in <I>sendmail.cf</I>.  This mechanism can be used to con-
          nect <B>dccm</B> on one computer to sendmail on another computer when a
          port and host name or IP address are used.

     <B ID="OPTION-m">-m</B> <I>map</I>
          specifies a name or path of the memory mapped parameter file instead
          of the default <I>/var/dcc/map</I>.  It should be created with the <B><A HREF="cdcc.html">cdcc(8)</A></B>
          command.

     <B ID="OPTION-w">-w</B> <I>whiteclnt</I>
          specifies an optional file containing filtering parameters as well
          as SMTP client IP addresses, SMTP envelope values, and header values
          of mail that is spam or is not spam and does not need a <I>X-DCC</I>
          header, and whose checksums should not be reported to the DCC
          server.

          If the pathname <I>whiteclnt</I> is not absolute, it is relative to the DCC
          home directory.

          The format of the <B>dccm</B> whiteclnt file is the same as the
          <I>/var/dcc/whitelist</I> files used by <B><A HREF="dbclean.html">dbclean(8)</A></B> and the <I>whiteclnt</I> file
          used by <B><A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc(8)</A></B>.  See <B><A HREF="dcc.html">dcc(8)</A></B> for a description of DCC white and
          blacklists.  Because the contents of the <I>whiteclnt</I> file are used
          frequently, a companion file is automatically created and main-
          tained.  It has the same pathname but with an added suffix of <I>.dccw</I>
          and contains a memory mapped hash table of the main file.

          A whitelist entry ("OK") or two or more semi-whitelistings ("OK2")
          for one of the message's checksums prevents all of the message's
          checksums from being reported to the DCC server and the addition of
          a <I>X-DCC</I> header line by <B>dccm</B>.  A whitelist entry for a checksum also
          prevents rejecting or discarding the message based on DCC recipient
          counts as specified by <B>-a</B> and <B>-t</B>.  Otherwise, one or more checksums
          with blacklisting entries ("MANY") cause all of the message's check-
          sums to be reported to the server with an addressee count of "MANY".

          If the message has a single recipient, an <I>env</I><B>_</B><I>To</I> <I>whiteclnt</I> entry of
          "OK" for the checksum of its recipient address acts like any other
          <I>whiteclnt</I> entry of "OK."  When the SMTP message has more than one
          recipient, the effects can be complicated.  When a message has sev-
          eral recipients with some but not all listed in the <I>whiteclnt</I> file,
          <B>dccm</B> tries comply with the wishes of the users who want filtering as
          well as those who don't by silently not delivering the message to
          those who want filtering (i.e. are not whitelisted) and delivering
          the message to users who don't want filtering.

     <B ID="OPTION-U">-U</B> <I>userdirs</I>
          enables per-user <I>whiteclnt</I> files and log directories.  Each target
          of a message can have a directory of log files named
          <I>usedirs/${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>userdir}/log</I> where <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>userdir}</I> is the <I>sendmail.cf</I>
          macro described below.  If <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>userdir}</I> is not set,
          <I>userdirs/${rcpt</I><B>_</B><I>mailer}/${rcpt</I><B>_</B><I>addr}/log</I> is used.  The most likely
          value of <I>mailer</I> is <I>local</I>.  Appropriate values for both
          <I>${rcpt</I><B>_</B><I>mailer}</I> and <I>${rcpt</I><B>_</B><I>addr}</I> can be seen by examining <I>env</I><B>_</B><I>To</I>
          lines in <B>-l</B> <I>logdir</I> files.  If it is not absolute, <I>userdirs</I> is rela-
          tive to the DCC home directory.  The directory containing the log
          files must be named <I>log</I> and it must be writable by the <B>dccm</B> process.
          Each log directory must exist or logging for the corresponding is
          silently disabled.  The files created in the log directory are owned
          by the UID of the <B>dccm</B> process, but they have <I>group</I> and <I>other</I> read
          and write permissions copied from the corresponding <I>log</I> directory.
          To ensure the privacy of mail, it may be good to make the directo-
          ries readable only by <I>owner</I> and <I>group</I>, and to use a cron script that
          changes the owner of each file to match the grandparent <I>addr</I> direc-
          tory.

          There can also be a per-user whitelist file named
          <I>userdirs/addr/whiteclnt</I> for each addressee <I>addr.</I> Any checksum that
          is not white- or blacklisted by an individual addressee's per-user
          <I>whiteclnt</I> file  is checked in the main <I>/var/dcc/whiteclnt</I> file.  A
          missing per-addressee <I>whiteclnt</I> file is the same as an empty file.
          Relative paths for files included in per-addressee files are
          resolved in the DCC home directory.  The <I>whiteclnt</I> files and the
          <I>addr</I> directories containing them must be writable by the <B>dccm</B>
          process.

          <I>Option</I> lines in per-user whiteclnt files can be used to modify many
          aspects of <B>dccm</B> filtering, as described in the main dcc man page.
          For example, an <I>option</I> <I>dcc-off</I> line turns off DCC filtering for
          individual mailboxes.

     <B ID="OPTION-a">-a</B> <I>IGNORE</I> | <I>REJECT</I> | <I>DISCARD</I>
          specifies the action taken when DCC server counts or <B>-t</B> thresholds
          say that a message is unsolicited and bulk.  <I>IGNORE</I> causes the mes-
          sage to be unaffected except for adding the <I>X-DCC</I> header line to the
          message.  This turns off all filtering except greylisting.

          Spam can also be <I>REJECT</I>ed or accepted and silently <I>DISCARD</I>ed without
          being delivered to local mailboxes.  The default is <I>REJECT</I>.

          Mail forwarded via IP addresses marked <I>MX</I> or <I>MXDCC</I> in the main
          <I>/var/dcc/whiteclnt</I> file is treated as if <B>-a</B> <I>DISCARD</I> were specified.
          This prevents "bouncing" spam.

          Determinations that mail is or is not spam from sendmail via
          <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> or <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>notspam}</I> macros override <B>-a</B>.  The effects of
          the <B>-w</B> <I>whiteclnt</I> are not affected by <B>-a</B>.

     <B ID="OPTION-t">-t</B> <I>type,</I>[<I>log-thold,</I>]<I>rej-thold</I>
          sets logging and "spam" thresholds for checksum <I>type</I>.  The checksum
          types are <I>IP</I>, <I>env</I><B>_</B><I>From</I>, <I>From</I>, <I>Message-ID</I>, <I>substitute</I>, <I>Received</I>,
          <I>Body</I>, <I>Fuz1</I>, <I>Fuz2</I>, <I>rep-total</I>, and <I>rep</I>.  The first six, <I>IP</I> through
          <I>substitute</I>, have no effect except when a local DCC server configured
          with <B>-K</B> is used.  The <I>substitute</I> thresholds apply to the first sub-
          stitute heading encountered in the mail message.  The string <I>ALL</I>
          sets thresholds for all types, but is unlikely to be useful except
          for setting logging thresholds.  The string <I>CMN</I> specifies the com-
          monly used checksums <I>Body</I>, <I>Fuz1</I>, and <I>Fuz2</I>.  <I>Rej-thold</I> and <I>log-thold</I>
          must be numbers, the string <I>NEVER</I>, or the string <I>MANY</I> indicating
          millions of targets.  Counts from the DCC server as large as the
          threshold for any single type are taken as sufficient evidence that
          the message should be logged or rejected.

          <I>Log-thold</I> is the threshold at which messages are logged.  It can be
          handy to log messages at a lower threshold to find solicited bulk
          mail sources such as mailing lists.  If no logging threshold is set,
          only rejected mail and messages with complicated combinations of
          white and blacklisting are logged.  Messages that reach at least one
          of their rejection thresholds are logged regardless of logging
          thresholds.

          <I>Rej-thold</I> is the threshold at which messages are considered "bulk,"
          and so should be rejected or discarded if not whitelisted.

          DCC Reputation thresholds in the commercial version of DCC are con-
          trolled by thresholds on checksum types <I>rep</I> and <I>rep-total</I>.  The DCC
          Reputations of IP addresses that the DCC database says have sent
          more than <I>rep-total,log-thold</I> are computed and messages from those
          addresses are logged.  Messages from IP addresses with DCC Reputa-
          tions of at least the <I>rep,rej-thold</I> rejection threshold can be
          rejected.  The DCC Reputation of an IP address is the percentage of
          its messages known to have been sent to at least 10 recipients.  The
          defaults are equivalent to <I>rep,never</I> and <I>rep-total,never,20</I>.

          Bulk DCC Reputations do not reject mail unless enabled by an
          <I>option</I> <I>DCC-rep-on</I> line a <I>whiteclnt</I> file.

          The checksums of locally whitelisted messages are not checked with
          the DCC server and so only the number of targets of the current copy
          of a whitelisted message are compared against the thresholds.

          The default is <I>ALL,NEVER</I>, so that nothing is discarded, rejected, or
          logged.  A common choice is <I>CMN,25,50</I> to reject or discard mail with
          common bodies except as overridden by the whitelist of the DCC
          server, the sendmail <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> and <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>notspam}</I> macros, and
          <B>-g</B>, and <B>-w</B>.

     <B ID="OPTION-g">-g</B> [<I>not-</I>]<I>type</I>
          indicates that whitelisted, <I>OK</I> or <I>OK2</I>, counts from the DCC server
          for a type of checksum are to be believed.  They should be ignored
          if prefixed with <I>not-</I>.  <I>Type</I> is one of the same set of strings as
          for <B>-t</B>.  Only <I>IP</I>, <I>env</I><B>_</B><I>From</I>, and <I>From</I> are likely choices.  By default
          all three are honored, and hence the need for <I>not-</I>.

     <B ID="OPTION-S">-S</B> <I>hdr</I>
          adds to the list of substitute or locally chosen headers that are
          checked with the <B>-w</B> <I>whiteclnt</I> file and sent to the DCC server.  The
          checksum of the last header of type <I>hdr</I> found in the message is
          checked.  <I>Hdr</I> can be <I>HELO</I> to specify the SMTP envelope HELO value.
          <I>Hdr</I> can also be <I>mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I> to specify the host name from the
          Mail_from value in the SMTP envelope.  As many as 8 different sub-
          stitute headers can be specified, but only the checksum of the first
          will be sent to the DCC server.

     <B ID="OPTION-l">-l</B> <I>logdir</I>
          specifies a directory in which files containing copies of messages
          processed by <B>dccm</B> are kept.  They can be copied to per-user directo-
          ries specified with <B>-U</B>.  Information about other recipients of a
          message is deleted from the per-user copies.

          See the FILES section below concerning the contents of the files.
          See also the <I>option</I> <I>log-subdirectory-{day,hour,minute}</I> lines in
          <I>whiteclnt</I> files described in <B><A HREF="dcc.html">dcc(8)</A></B>.

          The directory is relative to the DCC home directory if it is not
          absolute

     <B ID="OPTION-R">-R</B> <I>rundir</I>
          specifies the "run" directory where the UNIX domain socket and file
          containing the daemon's process ID are stored.  The default value is

     <B ID="OPTION-r">-r</B> <I>rejection-msg</I>
          specifies the rejection message for unsolicited bulk mail or for
          mail temporarily blocked by <I>greylisting</I> when <B>-G</B> is specified.  The
          first <B>-r</B> <I>rejection-msg</I> replaces the default bulk mail rejection mes-
          sage, "5.7.1 550 mail %ID from %CIP rejected by DCC".  The second
          replaces "4.2.1 452 mail %ID from %CIP temporary greylist embar-
          goed".  The third <B>-r</B> <I>rejection-msg</I> replaces the default SMTP rejec-
          tion message "5.7.1 550 %ID bulk mail reputation; see https://com-
          mercial-dcc.rhyolite.com/cgi-bin/reps.cgi?tgt=%CIP" for mail with
          bulk DCC Reputations.  If <I>rejection-msg</I> is the zero-length string,
          the <B>-r</B> setting is counted but the corresponding default message is
          not changed.

          <I>Rejection-msg</I> can contain specific information about the mail mes-
          sage.  The following strings starting with % are replaced with the
          corresponding values:
              %ID       message ID such as the unique part of log file name or
                        sendmail queue ID
              %CIP      SMTP client IP address
              %BTYPE    type of DNS blacklist hit, such as "SMTP client",
                        "mail_host", or "URL NS"
              %BTGT     IP address or name declared bad by DNS blacklist
              %BPROBE   domain name found in DNS blacklist such as
                        4.3.2.10.example.com
              %BRESULT  value of the %BPROBE domain name found in DNS black-
                        list

          A common alternate for the bulk mail rejection message is "4.7.1 451
          Access denied by DCC" to tell the sending mail system to continue
          trying.  Use a 4yz response with caution, because it is likely to
          delay for days a delivery failure message for false positives.  If
          the rejection message does not start with an RFC 1893 status code
          and RFC 2821 reply code, 5.7.1 and 550 or 4.2.1 and 452 are used.

          See also <B>-B</B> <I>set:rej-msg</I> to set the status message for mail rejected
          by DNS blacklists.

     <B ID="OPTION-j">-j</B> <I>maxjobs</I>
          limits the number of simultaneous requests that will be processed.
          The default value is the maximum number that seems to be possible
          given system limits on open files, select() bit masks, and so forth.
          Start <B>dccm</B> with <B>-d</B> and see the starting message in the system log to
          see the limit.

     <B ID="OPTION-B">-B</B> <I>dnsbl-option</I>
          enables DNS white- and blacklist checks of the SMTP client IP
          address, SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain name, and of host
          names in URLs in the message body.  Body URL blacklisting has too
          many false positives to use on abuse mailboxes.  It is less effec-
          tive than greylisting with <B>dccm(8)</B> or <B><A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd(8)</A></B> but can be useful in
          situations where greylisting cannot be used.  It can be combined
          with greylisting.

          <I>Dnsbl-option</I> is either one of the <B>-B</B> <I>set:option</I> forms or
              <B>-B</B> <I>domain</I>[any[<I>,bltype</I>]]
              <B>-B</B> <I>domain</I>[<I>,IPaddr</I>[<I>/xx</I>[<I>&amp;IPmask</I>][<I>,bltype</I>]]]
              <B>-B</B> <I>domain</I>[<I>,IPaddrLO</I>[<I>-IPaddrHI</I>[<I>&amp;IPmask</I>][<I>,bltype</I>]]]
          <I>Domain</I> is a DNS blacklist domain such as <I>example.com</I> that will be
          searched.  The strings <I>any</I>, <I>IPaddr</I>, <I>IPaddr/xx</I>, or <I>IPaddrLO-IPaddrHI</I>,
          specifies which IP addresses found in the DNS blacklist after apply-
          ing the optional IP address mask <I>IPmask</I> say that mail messages
          should be rejected or accepted with <B>-B</B> <I>set:white</I>.  "127.0.0.2" is
          assumed if no address(es) are specified.  IPv6 addresses can be
          specified with the usual colon (:) notation.  Host names can be used
          instead of numeric addresses.  The type of DNS blacklist is speci-
          fied by <I>bltype</I> as <I>name</I>, <I>all-names</I>, <I>IPv4</I>, or <I>IPv6</I>.  Given an envelope
          sender domain name or a domain name in a URL of spam.domain.org and
          a blacklist of type <I>name</I>, spam.domain.org.example.com will be looked
          up.  The names spam.domain.org.example.com, domain.org.example.com,
          and org.example.com will be looked up in blacklists of type
          <I>all-names</I>.  Use <I>name</I> with DNS blacklists that use wildcards for
          speed but <I>all-names</I> for other DNS name blacklists.  Blacklist types
          of <I>IPv4</I> and <I>IPv6</I> require that the domain name in a URL sender
          address be resolved into an IPv4 or IPv6 address.  The resolved
          address from the mail message is then written as a reversed string
          of decimal octets to check the DNS blacklist, as in
          <I>2.0.0.127.example.com</I>.

          A <I>domain</I> of "."  and type of <I>name</I> can be used to blacklist domain
          names with specified addresses.  This can be useful to detect URLs
          with domain names listed in a Response Policy Zone (RPZ).  For exam-
          ple, the following can be used to reject mail containing URLs listed
          by a response policy zone that maps evil domain names to 224.0.0.0
          with an informative status message:

            '-Bset:rej-msg=5.7.1 550 %ID %BTYPE \
                  https://example.com/query/dbl?domain=%BTGT'
            -B.,224.0.0.0,name

          More than one blacklist can be specified and blacklists can be
          grouped with <B>-B</B> <I>set:group=X</I>.  All searching within a group of black-
          lists is stopped at the first positive result.

          Unlike <B><A HREF="dccproc.html">dccproc(8)</A></B>, positive results are ignored by <B>dccm</B> after being
          logged unless an <I>option</I> <I>DNSBL-on</I> or <I>option</I> <I>DNSBLx-on</I> line appears a
          <I>whiteclnt</I> file.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-client</I>
               implies that SMTP client IP addresses and reverse DNS domain
               names should not be checked in the following blacklists.
               <B>-B</B> <I>set:client</I> restores the default for the following black-
               lists.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>
               implies that SMTP envelope Mail_From sender domain names should
               not be checked in the following blacklists.  <B>-B</B> <I>set:mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>
               restores the default.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-URL</I>
               says that URLs in the message body should not be checked in the
               in the following blacklists.  <B>-B</B> <I>set:URL</I> restores the default.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-MX</I>
               says MX servers of sender Mail_From domain names and host names
               in URLs should not be checked in the following blacklists.
               <B>-B</B> <I>set:MX</I> restores the default.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-NS</I>
               says DNS servers of sender Mail_From domain names and host
               names in URLs should not be checked in the following black-
               lists.  <B>-B</B> <I>set:NS</I> restores the default.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:white</I>
               says the DNS list is a whitelist of names or IP addresses.
               <B>-B</B> <I>set:black</I> restores the default.  DNS whitelist usually also
               need <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>, <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-URL</I>, <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-MX</I>,
               <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-NS</I>, and <B>-B</B> <I>set:no-mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:defaults</I>
               is equivalent to all of <B>-B</B> <I>set:black</I> <B>-B</B> <I>set:client</I>
               <B>-B</B> <I>set:mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I> <B>-B</B> <I>set:URL</I> <B>-B</B> <I>set:MX</I> and <B>-B</B> <I>set:NS</I>

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:group=X</I>
               adds following DNS blacklists specified with <B>-B</B> <I>domain</I>[<I>...</I>] to
               group 1, 2, 3, or 4.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:debug=X</I>
               sets the DNS blacklist logging level

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:msg-secs=S</I>
               limits <B>dccm</B> to <I>S</I> seconds total for checking all DNS blacklists.
               The default is 25.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:URL-secs=S</I>
               limits <B>dccm</B> to at most <I>S</I> seconds resolving and checking any
               single URL or IP address.  The default is 11.  Some spam con-
               tains dozens of URLs and some "spamvertised" URLs contain host
               names that need minutes to resolve.  Busy mail systems cannot
               afford to spend minutes checking each incoming mail message.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:rej-msg="rejection</I> <I>message"</I>
               sets the SMTP rejection message for the following blacklists.
               <I>Rejection-msg</I> must be in the same format as for <B>-r</B>.  If
               <I>rejection</I> <I>message</I> is null, the default is restored.  The
               default DNS blacklist rejection message is the first message
               set with <B>-r</B>.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:max</I><B>_</B><I>helpers=X</I>
               sets maximum number of helper processes to <I>X</I>.  In order to use
               typical single-threaded DNS resolver libraries, <B>dccm</B> uses
               fleets of helper processes.  It is rarely a good idea to change
               the default, which is the same as the maximum number of simul-
               taneous jobs set with <B>-j</B>.

          <B>-B</B> <I>set:progpath=/var/dcc/libexec/dns-helper</I>
               changes the path to the helper program.

     <B ID="OPTION-L">-L</B> <I>ltype,facility.level</I>
          specifies how messages should be logged.  <I>Ltype</I> must be <I>error</I>, <I>info</I>,
          or <I>off</I> to indicate which of the two types of messages are being con-
          trolled or to turn off all <B>syslog(3)</B> messages from <B>dccm</B>.  <I>Level</I> must
          be a <B>syslog(3)</B> level among <I>EMERG</I>, <I>ALERT</I>, <I>CRIT</I>, <I>ERR</I>, <I>WARNING</I>, <I>NOTICE</I>,
          <I>INFO</I>, and <I>DEBUG</I>.  <I>Facility</I> must be among <I>AUTH</I>, <I>AUTHPRIV</I>, <I>CRON</I>,
          <I>DAEMON</I>, <I>FTP</I>, <I>KERN</I>, <I>LPR</I>, <I>MAIL</I>, <I>NEWS</I>, <I>USER</I>, <I>UUCP</I>, and <I>LOCAL0</I> through
          <I>LOCAL7</I>.  The default is equivalent to
                <B>-L</B> <I>info,MAIL.NOTICE</I> <B>-L</B> <I>error,MAIL.ERR</I>

     <B>dccm</B> normally sends counts of mail rejected and so forth the to system
     log at midnight.  The SIGUSR1 signal sends an immediate report to the
     system log.  They will be repeated every 24 hours instead of at midnight.

<H2 ID="SENDMAIL-MACROS">SENDMAIL MACROS</H2><PRE>
     Sendmail can affect <B>dccm</B> with the values of some <I>sendmail.cf</I> macros.
     These macro names must be added to the Milter.macros option statements in
     <I>sendmail.cf</I> as in the example "Feature" file dcc.m4.

     <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I>  causes a mail message to be reported to the DCC server as
                    having been addressed to "MANY" recipients.  The
                    <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> macro is ignored if the <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>notspam}</I> macro
                    is set to a non-null string

                    If the value of the <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> is null, <B>dccm</B> uses SMTP
                    rejection messages controlled by <B>-a</B> and <B>-r</B>.  If the value
                    of the <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> macro starts with "DISCARD", the mail
                    message is silently discarded as with <B>-a</B> <I>DISCARD.</I> If value
                    of the macro not null and does not start with "DISCARD",
                    it is used as the SMTP error message given to the SMTP
                    client trying to send the rejected message.  The message
                    starts with an optional SMTP error type and number fol-
                    lowed by text.

                    The <B>-a</B> option does not effect messages marked spam with
                    <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I>.  When the <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> macro is set, the
                    message is rejected or discarded despite local or DCC
                    database whitelist entries.  The local whitelist does con-
                    trol whether the message's checksums will be reported to
                    the DCC server and an <I>X-DCC</I> SMTP header line will be
                    added.

     <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>notspam}</I>
                    causes a message not be considered unsolicited bulk
                    despite evidence to the contrary.  It also prevents <B>dccm</B>
                    from reporting the checksums of the message to the DCC
                    server and from adding an <I>X-DCC</I> header line.

                    When the macro is set by the <I>sendmail.cf</I> rules,
                    <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>notspam}</I> macros overrides DCC threshlds that say the
                    message should be rejected as well as the effects of the
                    <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>isspam}</I> macro.

     <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>mail</I><B>_</B><I>host}</I>
                    specifies the name of the SMTP client that is sending the
                    message.  This macro is usually the same as the <I>mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>
                    macro.  They can differ when a sendmail "smart relay" is
                    involved.  The <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>mail</I><B>_</B><I>host}</I> macro does not work if
                    <I>FEATURE(delay</I><B>_</B><I>checks)</I> is used, and so <B>dccm</B> falls back on
                    <I>mail</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>.

     <I>${dcc</I><B>_</B><I>userdir}</I>
                    is the per-user whitelist and log directory for a recipi-
                    ent.  If the macro is not set in sendmail.cf,
                    $&amp;{rcpt_mailer}/$&amp;{rcpt_addr} is assumed, but with the
                    recipient address converted to lower case.  Whatever value
                    is used, the directory name after the last slash (/) char-
                    acter is converted to lower case.  Any value containing
                    the string "/../" is ignored.

                    This macro also does not work if <I>FEATURE(delay</I><B>_</B><I>checks)</I> is
                    used.

                    The following two lines in a sendmail mc file have the
                    same effect as not defining the ${dcc_userdir} macro, pro-
                    vided <I>FEATURE(dcc)</I> is also used and the sendmail
                    <I>cf/feature</I> directory has a symbolic link to the
                    <I>/var/dcc/build/dcc/misc/dcc.m4</I> file.

                is replaced by the file name containing the daemon to facili-
                tate running multiple daemons, probably connected to remote
                instances of sendmail using TCP/IP instead of a UNIX domain
                socket.  See also <B>-R</B>.

                sendmail mc file that should have a symbolic link in the send-

                a sendmail mc file.

<H2 ID="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
     <B>Dccm</B> should be started before sendmail with something like the script
     <I>/var/dcc/libexec/start-dccm.</I> It looks for common DCC parameters in the
     <I>/var/dcc/dcc</I><B>_</B><I>conf</I> file.

     <SPAN="FILE-Those">Those</SPAN> numbers should modified to fit local conditions.  It might be wise
     <SPAN="FILE-to">to</SPAN> replace the "100" numbers with much larger values or with "MANY" until
     <SPAN="FILE-a">a</SPAN> few weeks of monitoring the log directory show that sources of mailing
     <SPAN="FILE-lists">lists</SPAN> are in the server's whitelist file (see <B><A HREF="dccd.html">dccd(8)</A></B>) or the local
     <I>/var/dcc/whiteclnt</I> file.

     <SPAN="FILE-It">It</SPAN> is usually necessary to regularly delete old log files with a script
     <SPAN="FILE-like">like</SPAN> /var/dcc/libexec/cron-dccd.

     <SPAN="FILE-On">On</SPAN> systems unlike modern FreeBSD and other UNIX-like systems which
     <SPAN="FILE-include">include</SPAN> sendmail milter support, sendmail must be built with the milter
     <SPAN="FILE-interface">interface</SPAN>, such as by creating a <I>devtools/Site/site.config.m4</I> or similar
     <SPAN="FILE-file">file</SPAN> containing something like the following lines:

           APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-D_FFR_MILTER=1')
           APPENDDEF(`conf_libmilter_ENVDEF', `-D_FFR_MILTER=1')

     <SPAN="FILE-Appropriate">Appropriate</SPAN> lines invoking the milter interface must be added to
     <I>sendmail.cf.</I> That can be done by putting a symbolic link to the the
     <SPAN="FILE-misc/dcc.m4">misc/dcc.m4</SPAN> file in the DCC source to the sendmail cf/feature directory
     <SPAN="FILE-and">and</SPAN> adding the line

           FEATURE(dcc)

     <SPAN="FILE-to">to</SPAN> the local .mc file.

     <SPAN="FILE-Note">Note</SPAN> that <B>dccm</B> should not be used with the Postfix milter mechanism.
     <SPAN="FILE-Instead">Instead</SPAN> use <B><A HREF="dccifd.html">dccifd(8)</A></B> as a before-queue filter as described in that man
     <SPAN="FILE-page.">page.</SPAN>
